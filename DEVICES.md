# Supported Devices

This document provides a list of the current Z-Wave devices that have been tested with the WZWave library.

Currently, a device on the supported list means that it was successfully tested by a WZWave user. Minimally, it shows up as a recognized device type (e.g. Unknown Switch) and it's primary function can be accessed (e.g. the switch can be turned on/off). Additional functionality may or may not be present (e.g. a power outlet may be controllable but not yet report energy usage).

If the device supports the Z-Wave "Manufacturer Specific" command class, then ideally the manufacturer name and device name have been entered in WZWave so that it can be recognized more specifically (e.g. Aeon Labs Smart Energy Strip).
