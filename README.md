## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a Java-native, open-source library for controlling Z-Wave
PC controllers. It was created using a combination of studying online resources, studying the
[open-zwave project](https://code.google.com/p/open-zwave/) as well as copious amounts
of reverse engineering.

Note: The project is not affiliated or endorsed by Sigma Designs and none of their IP was used
in the creation of this library.
