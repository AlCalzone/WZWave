## Overview

in the creation of this library.

The goal of this project is to create a native, open-source Z-Wave library for Java.
It was created using a combination of studying online resources, studying the
[open-zwave project](https://code.google.com/p/open-zwave/) as well as copious amounts
of reverse engineering.
